# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 Summary â€“ Arrays in JavaScript

Welcome to **Day 4** of the 100 Days of DSA Challenge!

Today we dived deeper into one of the most fundamental data structures â€“ **Arrays**. Arrays in JavaScript are versatile and form the foundation for many DSA problems. We explored how they work under the hood and practiced solving a few related problems.

## âœ… What We Covered

- What is an Array  
- How arrays are stored in **contiguous memory**  
- Difference between **fixed-size arrays** in low-level languages vs dynamic arrays in JavaScript  
- Common array methods and their usage:  
  - `includes()` â€“ check if an element exists  
  - `indexOf()` â€“ find the position of an element  
  - `slice()` â€“ get a portion of the array (non-mutating)  
  - `splice()` â€“ remove or insert elements (mutating)  
- Time Complexity of built-in JavaScript array methods:  
  - Access by index â€“ `O(1)`  
  - Search (`includes`, `indexOf`) â€“ `O(n)`  
  - Insert/remove at end (`push`, `pop`) â€“ `O(1)`  
  - Insert/remove at beginning (`shift`, `unshift`) â€“ `O(n)`  
  - Insert/remove in middle (`splice`) â€“ `O(n)`

## ðŸ§© Problems We Solved
We practiced solving basic array manipulation problems, such as:

- Searching for an element in an array
- Inserting a number at a specific position
- Removing elements based on a condition or index
- Variations of the above to strengthen understanding

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway

Arrays are simple yet powerful. Mastering their behavior and built-in methods is crucial before moving on to more complex data structures. Understanding time complexity helps us write more optimized and efficient code.

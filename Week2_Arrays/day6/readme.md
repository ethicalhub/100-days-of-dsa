# üß† Array Practice ‚Äì DSA Challenge (Rotation & Shifting)

Today we continued practicing key array manipulation techniques, focusing on **zero shifting** and **rotations** ‚Äî essential for mastering problem-solving patterns in DSA and excelling in coding interviews.

## ‚úÖ Problems Covered

### üìå P1: Move Zeroes to the End
We explored multiple variations:
- Using swap with backtracking (`i--` or `i = i - 2`)
- Bubble-style shifting
- In-place logic without extra space

üîó Leetcode: [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

---

### üìå P2: Left Rotate Array by One
- Shift all elements left and move the first element to the end.
- Practiced clean, efficient O(n) implementation with in-place logic.

---

### üìå P3: Left Rotate Array by K
- Implemented using repeated left rotations (O(k√ón))

---

### üìå P4: Right Rotate Array by K
- Practiced shifting right using reverse logic
- Compared brute-force rotation with optimized reverse-based O(n) solution

üîó Leetcode (attempted): [Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Faced **Time Limit Exceeded** on Leetcode brute-force implementation, later optimized using reversal method.

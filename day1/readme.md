# ðŸ“˜ Day 1 Summary â€“ JavaScript Basics

Welcome to **Day 1** of the 100 Days of DSA Challenge!

Today we focused on understanding the foundational concepts of **JavaScript**, which will act as a strong base for solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems with confidence.

## âœ… What We Covered

- What is programming and why it's important  
- Why JavaScript for DSA  
- First program in JS (`console.log`)  
- Variables and data types (`var`, `let`, `const`)  
- Primitive vs. Non-primitive types  
- How the JS engine executes code (line-by-line, synchronously)  
- Arrays and Objects â€“ syntax and access  
- Functions â€“ declaration, expression, arrow functions  
- Loops â€“ `for`, `while`, and basic usage

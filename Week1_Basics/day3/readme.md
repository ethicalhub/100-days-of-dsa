# ✅ Day 3 Summary – 100 Days of DSA Challenge

## 📘 Theory Covered:

### ⏱ Time Complexity:
- Defined what time complexity is and why it differs from actual execution time.
- Explored how code scales with input size.
- Analyzed loop variations and their time implications:
  - Simple loops → O(n)
  - Nested loops → O(n²)
  - Logarithmic loops → O(log n)
  - N log N → O(n log n)
  - Exponential → O(2ⁿ)

### 🧮 Big-O, Theta, Omega:
- **Big-O (O)** – Worst-case upper bound
- **Theta (θ)** – Average/typical case
- **Omega (Ω)** – Best-case lower bound

### 🎯 Case Analysis:
- Upper bound, lower bound, worst case, best case, average case
- Why we **ignore constants** and **lower terms** in Big-O.

### 💾 Space Complexity:
- What space complexity means in terms of memory usage.
- Calculated based on variables, call stack, and extra data structures.
- 💡 Note: Never manipulate the input just to save space!

## ✏️ Practiced:

### 🧪 Time & Space Estimations:
- Estimated complexity for different code snippets:
  - Loops, nested loops, logarithmic iterations

---

## 🔥 Progress Highlights:
- Gained a clear understanding of Time vs. Space trade-offs.
